# What is reproducibility?

# Project stages to implement a reproducible workflow ideas

- Development: how to develop a project
    - Write code in a script to perform a data analysis, data visualization, etc
    - Code is editable and reusable
    - Write comments and use good names 
- Collaboration: how to work with others 
    - Send code and data to colleagues via email, Google Drive, etc
    - Create file naming convention to keep track of files
    - Advanced: Use software collaboration tool [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Distribution: how to distribute your work to others
    - Share code, data, and supporting files to colleagues so they can run it independently
    - Goal is for output to be exactly the same regardless of where the code is run
