# Motivation

- Going back to the **storage** problem: how do we store data in a format that R recognizes
- Data types allow us to group related data
- Data structures provide an interface to organize, manage, and store our data.
- The data type and data structure define how we interact with the object

## Goals moving forward:
- Introduce fundamental data types and data structures
- Build up to the `data frame` data structure


---

# Data Types

<br>  

.center[
`r knitr::asis_output(paste(readLines('slides/tables/data-types.txt'), collapse = '\n'))`
]

---

# Checking the type

- We can confirm the type of an object by using the `typeof()` function.

<br>  

.code-bg[
```{r data-types, collapse = TRUE}
typeof(1L)
typeof(1.5)
typeof("hello")
typeof(TRUE)
typeof(NULL)
```
]

# Vectors

**vector**: a sequence of values where each value must be of the same type

- Vectors are objects

- Vectors are everywhere!

- 

- We can create a vector of each of the types: `integer`, `double`, `character`, `logical`

---

---

# Vectors in R

- Create vectors with the `c()` function. Separate values with a comma
- The c stands for combine.
- Check that an object is a vector with `is.vector()`

.code-bg[
```{r vectors, collapse=TRUE}
# note the L after the integer
integer_vector <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)
typeof(integer_vector)

double_vector <- c(1L, 2.5, 3/7)
typeof(double_vector)

# notice the capitalization
logical_vector <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
typeof(logical_vector)

character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")
typeof(character_vector)

# check if it's a vector - outputs true or false
is.vector(character_vector)
```
]

---

# Vector structure

### Element names

- Each element of a vector can be assigned a name as well. Call this the **element name** to distinguish from **name**
- A typical use case for this is to label a numerical value with informative text

<br>  

### Indices

- The **indices** give the position of an element
- Indices are integers that always start at 1 and increment by 1 to the length of the vector

# Detailed Vector mental model

# Setting element names

- We set element names for a vector with the `names()` function.
- Access the element names with `names(your_vector)`
- Note that the element names of a vector is another vector.

.code-bg[
```{r vector-names1, collapse=TRUE}
month_days <- c(31, 28, 31, 30, 31)
month_days

# set element names
names(month_days) <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May")
names(month_days)

# note the element names associated with each element now
month_days

# names(month_days) is a vector
is.vector(names(month_days))
```
]

---

# Setting element names

- Alternatively, specify a `name = value` pair when you create the vector   

.code-bg[
```{r vector-names2, collapse=TRUE}
month_days <- c("Jan" = 31, 
                "Feb" = 28, 
                "Mar" = 31, 
                "Apr" = 30, 
                "May" = 31)
month_days

# names(month_days) is a vector
is.vector(names(month_days))
```
]

---

# Useful functions for vectors

- Many functions expect a vector as an argument.

.code-bg[
```{r vector-functions, collapse = TRUE}
x <- c(-2, 0, 2, 4)

# compute sum of all elements in a vector
sum(x)
# compute mean of all elements in a vector
mean(x)
# compute standard devation of all elements in a vector
sd(x)
# get minimum value in a vector
min(x)
# get minimum value in a vector
max(x)
# get the length of a vector
length(x)
```
]

---

# Useful functions for vectors ...

- `seq()` generates a sequence of values
- `rep` repeats elements in a vector

.code-bg[
```{r more-vector-functions, collapse = TRUE}
# use the colon to get a sequence of numbers
x <- c(1:10)
x

# or use seq() for more flexibility
a <- seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1)
a

y_alternate <- rep(x = c(1,2), times = 5)
y_alternate

y_element_wise <- rep(x = c(1,2), each = 5)
y_element_wise

y_same_length <- rep(x = c(1,2), length.out = 5)
y_same_length

```
]

---

# Vector Operations

- Arithmetic (`+, -, *, /`) is done element-wise with vectors.

## Code Example
.code-bg[
```{r vector-operations, collapse=TRUE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c(1, 4, 9)

x + y

y - x

x * y

y / x
```
]

- When vectors are the same length (have the same number of elements), arithmetic is intuitive.

---

# Vectorized operations

- Element-wise operations are also called **vectorized** operations
- The idea is that I don't need to explicitly specify an operation on each element of a vector - the operation is applied to each element
- **Vectorized** operations simplify our code

### Example - Square root

.code-bg[
```{r vectorization, collapse=TRUE}
x <- c(1, 4, 9, 16, 25)
x

sqrt(x)
```
]

---

# Vectorized operations

- *Vectorized* operations will save us a lot of time and effort when our operations become complex

### Without vectorized operations
.code-bg[
```{r without-vectorization, collapse=TRUE}
x <- c(1, 4, 9, 16, 25)
n <- length(x)
result <- rep(NA_integer_, n) 
for (i in seq_len(n)) {
  result[i] <- x[i] ^ (1/2)
}
result
```
]


---

# Vector Recycling

- It turns out that you can perform vector operations on vectors of unequal length
- R deals with unequal length by "recycling" the shorter vector to the length of the longer vector

## Code Example

.code-bg[
```{r vector-recycling, collapse = TRUE}
# note: x is a vector - a length one vector!
x <- 5
y <- c(1, 2, 3)

# behind the scenes, R recycles the value 5 until the
# vector x looks like this: c(5, 5, 5)
# then, it is the usual element-wise operation
x * y

x + y
```
]

---

# Vector Recycling

- In theory, vector recycling can work when you have any pairs of varying vector lengths.
- But, the behavior is hard to predict and keep track of. 
- I suggest to stick with the case where *one vector is length 1 and the other vector is some arbitrary length*

## Code Example
.code-bg[
```{r vector-recycling2, collapse = TRUE}
x <- c(1, 2)
y <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

# x becomes: c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1)
# so x + y = c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1) + c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
x + y
```
]

- Notice the warning - it's encouraging us to try to keep the longer vector a multiple of the shorter vector 

---

# Vector Coercion

- Recall that all elements in a vector must be of the same type
- If we try to circumvent this property, R converts all elements to the same type through **coercion**. 

.code-bg[
```{r vector-coercion1, collapse = TRUE}
# integer and double
x <- c(1L, 2.3)
x
typeof(x)

# character and double
y <- c("1", 1)
y
typeof(y)

# double and logical
z <- c(1, TRUE)
z
typeof(z)
```
]

---

# Vector Coercion Rule

- One rule summarizes what happens when combining different types

.center[
**Coercion rule:** character → double → integer → logical
]

<br>  

- Types downstream on the chain are converted to the highest type on the chain

- Notice that the most general type (`character`) takes precedence - the character type can sensibly represent data of the `double`, `integer`, or `logical` class

.code-bg[
```{r character-type, eval = FALSE}
# character
"uci"
# double as character
"1.5"
# integer as character
"1"
# logical as character
"TRUE"
```
]

---

# Vector coercion

- Be mindful of vector coercion - it may happen silently without your awareness

### Common situations where vector coercion can occur 

- You use data from multiple sources - certain variables may be stored differently

- Some functions may need to convert to a specific type to perform some task

---

# Why use a vector?

- *Consistency*: data is all of the same type; allowable operations are defined accordingly

- For example, how is arithmetic defined for vectors with a mix of character and numeric values?

- Enforcing homogeneous type will make our code more predictable and manageable

---

# Lists

- **list**: a sequence of values where each value can have different types

- Lists are objects

- Lists are the most flexible data structure

- Think of lists as generalizations of vectors
    - **Vectors** hold *homogeneous* data
    - **Lists** hold *heterogeneous* data
    
- Since lists are more general and heterogeneous, it is harder to classify them like with vectors


---

# List mental model

.center[
![Lists](images/list.png)
]

---

# Lists in R

- Create lists with the `list()` function. Separate values with a comma
- Check that an object is a list with `is.list()`
- Just like with vectors, we can name each element of a list with `names()`

.code-bg[
```{r lists, collapse=TRUE}
my_list <- list(1L, "hello", TRUE, 1.5)
my_list

# names(my_list) is still a vector
names(my_list) <- c("integer", "character", "logical", "double")
names(my_list)
```
]

---

# Why use a list?

- The raw data you receive is "hierarchical"

# Why use a list?

- Apply common operations to data from different time periods
```{r list-df, eval = FALSE}
# read in data
lab_Jan2020 <- read.csv(file = "lab_results_Jan-2020.csv")
lab_Feb2020 <- read.csv(file = "lab_results_Feb-2020.csv")
lab_Mar2020 <- read.csv(file = "lab_results_Mar-2020.csv")

lab_data_all <- list(lab_Jan2020, lab_Feb2020, lab_Mar2020)

clean_data(lab_data_all)
plot_data(lab_data_all)
build_model(lab_data_all)
```

# Matrices

- **matrix**: a 2-dimensional rectangular table of values where every value must be the same type

- Matrices are objects

- Matrices hold **homogeneous** data

- Commonly, you use matrices with numbers. 
    
- Since we are in 2D, we use **rows** and **columns** to index a matrix

---

# Matrix mental model

![Matrix](images/matrix.png)

---

# Matrices in R

- Create a matrix with the `matrix()` function
- For a matrix, we need to provide some data to fill the matrix
- Check that an object is a vector with `is.matrix()`

```{r matrix, collapse=TRUE}
