# Learning Objectives

.lots-of-text-font[
1. Define what an object is
2. Discuss why objects are important in R
3. Give examples of objects in R
4. Create objects in R
5. Give a definition for a function.
6. Identify the three components of a function.

# Why are objects important?

- Everything in R is an object
- We need a way to *store* data in R so that we can *access* and *manipulate* the data for our needs.

## 3 problems to address:

**Storage**: how do we store data in a format that R recognizes

**Access**: how do we refer to and manage our data in a sensible manner

**Manipulation**: how to select and change slices of our data

- We will cover the access problems in this section. The storage problem will be covered in the `Data Types and Data Structures` section and manipulation problem is addressed in the `Data Management` section.

# Names, values, and objects

<br>

.big-text-font[
> **value**: something that can be manipulated by R. Most likely, numbers or text.

> **name**: a reference to a value. Synonymous with **variable** or **symbol**

> **object**: a value that is referenced by a name

- Objects address the **access** problem.

- Objects hold values (numbers, text)

- Names are references to an object

# Assignment operator

- Now, how do we do associate an **object** with a **name**?
- We use the **assignment operator** `<-` or `=` to "bind" an object to a name.
- Binding links an object to a name. 

## Code Example

- In words: create an object of the value `3` and bind that object to the name `three`.

.code-bg[
```{r binding-example}
three <- 3
# print the value 3 to the console
# notice how we can use the name to reference the object
three
```
]

# Notes on names, assignment, and values

> The same value can be referenced by multiple names

.code-bg[
```{r}
x <- 3
y <- 3
x
```
]

> A name can only reference one value

.code-bg[
```{r}
# first, x references 1
x <- 1
# now, x references 2
x <- 2
x
```
]

# Benefits of objects

- Many values (data) to store and manage
- Need systematic way to refer to these values
- Objects allow us to link values and names
- Reusability: Names allow us to reference and use objects in multiple locations
- Readability: Objects are associated with informative names

# Real world example
- Suppose we want to determine how much our business pays in corporate taxes.

.code-bg[
```{r business-example}
corporate_tax_rate <- 8.8
gross_income <- 5000000
# 5,000,000 * (8.8 / 100) = 5,000,000 * 0.088
gross_income * (corporate_tax_rate / 100)
```

# Functions

.big-text-font[
- Functions are objects that run some R code when we refer to them by their name 
- Functions can be distinguished from other objects if we see a set of parentheses after the function name
- A functions can have arguments (inputs) in the form of `argument_name = argument_value`.
- Each argument is separated by commas
]

```
# argument names are not surrounded in "" or ''
# use an equal sign = to relate each argument name and value pair
make_salad(cucumber = 0.5,
           bell_pepper = 0.5,
           tomato = 1,
           onions = 0.2,
           spinach = 2)
```

# Function example

.code-bg[
```{r mean}
# 1. create an object, a vector of 5 numerical values
# 2. assign the name, numbers, to reference this object
numbers <- c(2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
# note that numbers is a reference to the vector
# so, we can use the actual vector itself in lieu of numbers
numbers

mean(x = numbers)
# same thing
mean(x = c(2, 2, 2, 2, 2))
```
]

.code-bg[
```{r print}
print(x = "Hello World!")
```
