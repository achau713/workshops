# Data Management

.big-text-font[
- Now, we'll address the **manipulation problem**: how to select and change slices of our data

- The focus is on data frames but other data structures will be discussed

Data management is a broad topic, so I'll focus on a few common tasks

1. Select specific columns
2. Create a new column
3. Filter data given a condition
4. Rename column
5. Group data into subsets
]

# Background

.big-text-font[
- R provides **subsetting** operators that allow us to select data in complex and useful ways

- **Subsetting** is the action of selecting specific pieces of our data

- How we subset data is dependent on the data type and data structure
]

- ### There are three **subsetting** operators: `[[`, `[`, `$`

- ### The `[` and `[[` have another set of brackets

# Vector mental model

.big-text-font[
- Recall our vector mental model
]

---

# Subset a vector with the `[` operator

.big-text-font[
- Within the brackets, we can provide a integer, character, or logical vector
- Supply an integer vector to select by index
- Supply an character vector to select by element name
- Supply an logical vector to select by condition
]

---

# Subset a vector with integers

.big-text-font[
- Subset with positive or negative integers
]

.code-bg[
```{r subset-vector-integer, collapse=TRUE, error=TRUE}
x <- c(-1, 0, 2, 3)

# notice the use of c() inside the bracket for vector length > 1

# select the first element
x[1]

# select first and fourth element
x[c(1, 4)]

# exclude first and fourth element
x[c(-1, -4)]

# can't combine positive and negative indices
x[c(-1, 2)]
```
]

---

# Subset a vector with element names

.big-text-font[
- Subset with element names
]

.code-bg[
```{r subset-vector-names, collapse=TRUE}
month_days <- c(31, 28, 31, 30, 31)
names(month_days) <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May")

# c() is not required for a length one subsetting vector
month_days["Feb"]
month_days[c("Jan", "Apr")]
```
]

---

# Aside: logical operators

.big-text-font[
- R has built-in **logical operators** (operators used to evaluate whether a condition is true or false)
]

<br>  

.center[
`r knitr::asis_output(paste(readLines('slides/data-management/tables/simple-logical-operators.txt'), collapse = '\n'))`
]

---

# Logical operators example

.code-bg[
```{r logical-operators, collapse=TRUE}
x <- c(-10, -1, 0, 2, 3)

# remember vector recycling: (-10, -1, 0, 2, 3) > (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
# x > 0 returns a logical vector of the same length as z
x > 0

# select and return all elements greater than 0
x[x > 0]

# select and return all elements less than or equal to 0
x[x <= 0]

# select and return all elements equal to -10
x[x == -10]

# select and return all elements greater than 5
x[x > 5]
```
]

---

# Aside: boolean operators

.big-text-font[
- R has built-in **boolean operators** (operators used to chain together multiple logical expressions)
]

<br>  

.center[
`r knitr::asis_output(paste(readLines('slides/data-management/tables/boolean-operators.txt'), collapse = '\n'))`
]

---

# `!` boolean operator example

- `!` reverses the logical value (`TRUE` becomes `FALSE`, `FALSE` becomes TRUE)

.code-bg[
```{r boolean-operators-not, collapse=TRUE}
# assume that foods are either fruits or vegetables
x <- c("apple", "spinach", "broccolli", "blueberry", "carrot")

fruit <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
fruit

# return fruits
x[fruit]

# reverse each logical value in fruit
vegetable <- !fruit
vegetable

# return vegetables
x[vegetable]

```
]

---

# `|` and `&` boolean operator example

- `!` evaluates to TRUE if at least one logical expression is true
- `&` evaluates to TRUE if and only if all logical expressions are true
- Use parentheses to separate logical expressions

.code-bg[
```{r boolean-operators-not-and, collapse=TRUE}
x <- c(-100, -67, -34, 0, 5, 7, 15, 15, 50)

# return elements that are equal to -100 OR elements greater than 0
x[(x == -100) | (x > 0)]
# return elements that are less than or equal to 0 or elements greater than 0
x[(x <= 0) | (x > 0)]

# return elements that are less than or equal AND greater than or equal to 0
x[(x <= 0) & (x >= 0)]
# return elements that are less than or equal to zero AND greater than 0
x[(x <= 0) & (x > 0)]
```
]

---

# Subset a vector given a condition

.big-text-font[
- Subset with logical vectors
]

.code-bg[
```{r subset-vector-logical, collapse=TRUE}
mascots <- c("Peter", "Tommy", "King Triton", 
             "Josephine", "Oski", "King Triton")
names(mascots) <- c("UCI", "USC", "UCSD", "UCLA", "UCB", "UCSD")
uc_campus <-c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE) 
# select elements that equal "Peter" or elements that equal "Peter"
mascots[mascots == "Peter" | mascots == "King Triton"]

# select non-UC campuses
!uc_campus
mascots[!uc_campus]

# select elements with element name "UCSD"
mascots[names(mascots) == "UCSD"]
```

# 6 ways to subset a vector

.center[
`r knitr::asis_output(paste(readLines('slides/data-management/tables/vector-subsetting.txt'), collapse = '\n'))`
]

---

# Subset a list with `[`

- Subsetting a list with `[` will always return a list 
- Just like vectors, you can supply a vector when using `[`


.code-bg[
```{r list-subset-single-bracket1, collapse=TRUE, error=TRUE}
l <- list(letter = "a", number = 1, 
          boolean = TRUE, ones_vector = c(1,1,1), 
          my_list = list(1,2,3))

l[1]
is.list(l[1])

l["boolean"]
is.list(l["boolean"])
```
]

---

# Subset a list with `[`

- All the ways to subset a vector carry through when subsetting a list with `[`

.code-bg[
```{r list-subset-single-bracket2, collapse=TRUE, error=TRUE}
l <- list(letter = "a", number = 1, 
          boolean = TRUE, num_vector = c(1,2,3), 
          my_list = list(1,2))

# vectors allowed
l[c("boolean", "number")]
is.list(l[c("boolean", "number")])

# negative integers allowed
l[c(-2, -3, -4, -5)]
is.list(l[c(-2, -3, -4, -5)])
```
]

---

# Subset a list with `[[`

- Subsetting a list with `[[` returns a single element in the list (the element *could* be a list)
- When using `[[`, you can supply a single positive integer, a single element name, or a vector
- If you use a vector with `[[`, you will subset recursively

.code-bg[
```{r list-subset-dollar-sign, collapse=TRUE, error=TRUE}
l <- list(letter = "a", number = 1, boolean = TRUE, num_vector = c(1,2,3))

l[[1]]
is.list(l[[1]])
l[["boolean"]]
is.list(l[["boolean"]])

# l[[c(4,3)]] = l[[4]][[3]]
l[[c(4, 3)]]
# no negative integers
l[[-2]]
```
]

---

# Subset a list with `$`

- Subsetting a list with `$` is a shorthand for subsetting with `[[`
- `l$element_name` = `l[["element_name"]]`

.code-bg[
```{r list-subset-double-bracket, collapse=TRUE, error=TRUE}
l <- list(letter = "a", number = 1, boolean = TRUE, ones_vector = c(1,1,1))

l$letter
is.list(l$letter)

l[["letter"]]
is.list(l[["letter"]])
```
]

# Subset a matrix with `[`

- Subsetting a matrix with `[` is similar to subsetting a vector with `[`
- Since a matrix is 2-dimensional, we select rows and columns with `m[row, column]`
- Then, we can provide a vector for each dimension to select specific rows and columns.

.code-bg[
```{r subset-matrix1, collapse=TRUE}
m <- matrix(1:16, nrow = 4, ncol = 4)
colnames(m) <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
m

# first row, second column
m[1, 2]

# first and third row; column a and column c
m[c(1, 3), c("a", "c")]
```
]

---

# Subset a matrix with `[`

- Syntax to **select all rows**, `m[, columns]`
- Syntax to **select all columns**, `m[rows, ]`

.code-bg[
```{r subset-matrix2, collapse=TRUE}
m <- matrix(1:16, nrow = 4, ncol = 4)
colnames(m) <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
m

# all rows; first and third column
m[, c(1, 3)]

# first and second row; all columns
m[c(1, 4), ]
```
]

---

# Subset a matrix with `[`

- Subset a matrix with a single vector
- Each element in a matrix is stored in column-major order 
.center[
**column major order:**
<br>  
start at top-left corner -> move down a column -> 
start at top of adjacent column
]

.code-bg[
```{r subset-matrix3, collapse=TRUE}
m <- matrix(1:16, nrow = 4, ncol = 4)
colnames(m) <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
m

# select first element and third element
m[c(1,3)]
```
]
