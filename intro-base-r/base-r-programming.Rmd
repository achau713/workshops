- R Fundamentals
  - Basic data structures
    - Numbers.
    - Vectors: logical, numeric, character
    - Strings 
    - Factors 
    - Data frames
    - Lists 
    - dates, date-times
  - Functions
    - What is a function?
    - Object which perform specific task
    - Components of a function
      - Arguments
      - Body
      - Environment
    - When to use a function?
      - You have repeated code that does the same thing
      - DRY: Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself
    - Why to use functions?
      - Make code modular, explicit and clear
      - Organize code into manageable and contextual chunks 
    - What makes a good function
      - Relevant function name and arugment names
      - "General". Will work on many inputs or inputs of the same type.
      - Does 1 thing really well
      - Function composition: chain simple functions together to do more specific things.
      - Try not to hard code parameters. (if something can vary, let it vary)
        - ie: exact variable names into your function body (there is no guarantee the variable name will stay the same or be the same across all users and environments)
      - Includes unit tests 
        - Examples:
          - Check if the column is numeric.
          - Check if intended data structure is supplied
    - Error-Handling
      - What to do when your code fails?
      - Print informative message
      - Return something that will help you debug
    - Code style, clarity, and consistency
    - Consistent naming style for variables, functions, other objects
    - Camel case
    - Underscores or dashes
    - No spaces, please
    - Think of your scripts as a composition of different functions. .
    - Include useful comments
    - Combining code and words (R Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks)
  - Basic data cleaning:
    - Reading data
    - Subsetting. Filtering
    - Logical subsetting in R
    - Missing Data
    - complete.cases()
    - Merging (joins)
    - Exporting Data
  - Project Management
    - R Studio Projects
    - Using the here() library - making file paths less annoying
    - Folder structure
    - Github/other version control software
    - Using the renv() library - package dependency management
  - Introduce the Tidyverse (dplyr, purrr, stringr)
    - Give brief summary of what each package focuses on
    - Give examples of function usage
