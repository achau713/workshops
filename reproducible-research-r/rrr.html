# Motivation

---
class: inverse, center, middle

## What is reproducible research?

--
&gt; research that allows others to produce the same 
&gt; results and conclusions *when* given access to the same source materials 


---
class: left, top

## **Similar Terms**

--

### Replicability

--
&gt; when other researchers can reach the same conclusions, independent of the original study.

--
&gt; That is, the same data and methods are not necessarily used, but results are the same or consistent with the original study.

--

### Repeatablity

--
&gt; over multiple trials, the original author uses the same methods on 
&gt; the same data and gets the same results and conclusions

???
For tenure slide:
A bit of a joke. 
I couldn't come up with anything to put in that slot.
It could mean many things: 
  - Either no one cares about what you're working on
  - Or you are untouchable in your field

---

## Why reproducible research?

--

- Show evidence of the correctness of your results

- Enable others to use and extend your methods

- Increase transparency of research studies

- Encourage clear and thorough documentation of methods, decisions, procedures, results, conclusions, everything!

- Question: How much of research is for yourself vs for others?

---

## Practical Examples

--

1. You work on a long term project (timeline of several years) and want to guarantee consistent results throughout the project.

  - How do you ensure consistent results whether you
    run your code in Year 1 or Year 3?

2. You work on a project with collaborators. 

  - How to ensure consistent results for everyone?
  - How to maintain a reproducible environment?

3. You publish something and someone wants to reproduce your results.
  
  - Is your research publicly visible?
  - Does your project provide the complete environment to fully reproduce your methods and results?

4. Someone tries to reproduce your study and gets differing results.
  - How to diagnose? 


---

## Challenges

--
- The assets of a research study are constrained by law or other restrictions to the team conducting the study.
   
- The results of some studies may be variable (naturally). Then, some standard should be enacted to determine what constitutes a "consistent" result.

- Impractical reasons (expensive, time-constraints, ethical reasons)

- Limited access to computing resources

- High barrier to entry to use tools for reproducible research
  
- Question: Are researchers and faculty incentivized to produce reproducible research?  ü§î

???
- Assets of research study: data, methods
- Learning new tools requires a high upfront investment of time and energy. 
- Also, the benefits of using these tools are reaped primarily in the long-term. In other words, it takes quite a bit of impetus to get started and it

# Literate Programming
*Proposed by Donald Knuth, 1983*
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

--
&gt; a programming style that interweaves text, images, diagrams with code into a single unified document. 
&gt; &lt;br&gt;

--
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; "Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to 
&gt; do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a 
&gt; computer to do." 
&gt; &lt;br&gt;

--
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; "... Consider[..] programs to be works of literature"

## Why Literate Programming

***

.pull-left[
### Benefits
- Communicate your work to a broader audience. Tell a story.
- Practice explaining your work (teaching others about your work is a productive way to better understand your field and the topics you research)
- Have drafts to use for larger research papers
- Create a culture of sharing and learning:
- Encourage more thorough, rigorous, and nuanced analyses
]

.pull-right[
### Challenges
- Slower development time. 
  - Write code + explain code = üôÄ
  
- Requires adoption of literate programming standards and tools by colleagues and collaborators
  - Network effect: Tools work better when more people use it
]


    
???
- Not everyone involved in decision-making will know (or want to learn) how to read just vanilla code and comments.
- That said, communicate your ideas and work through other mediums. You don't have to include only written texts -- images, diagrams, links to a related topics are all fair to include in the final product. 
- To make it more flowery, you can think about crafting a narrative or story. Tell a story about your work. Discuss your observations, decisions, and conclusions.
- Faculty, researchers, students can share the products of literate programming
- Anyone can read the documents and learn from them on their own time 
- Questions and comments can be brought up through email, in-person, or through GitHub (more on this).
- There are many tools to analyze data. Does this mean we can apply things left and right?
- With the advent of powerful software packaged right out-of-the-box, it becomes trivial to type one line of code, get some decent output, and call it a day.
- Instead, spend time thinking about the software you develop. 
- Are the ideas I express through my code clear and intuitive? Software is a network of ideas.
- Can I translate those ideas into text, images, diagrams?
- How do I communicate my work to a collaborator? What assumptions do I need to make? How should I word things?

## Tools for collaboration and sharing

### Version control system (Git)

- A system to track changes to your files
- Tailored and optimized for software development
- Compare files line-by-line for: `.R, .py, .sas, .md, .cpp` file types and many more
- Similar idea to version history on Google Docs and Microsoft Word


### Software Hosting Platform

- A place to store, view, and share your software, analyses, and more.
- Popular options: [**GitHub**](github.com), [Gitlab](gitlab.com), [Bitbucket](bitbucket.com) 


---
## Benefits

### Why version control?

- Backup your projects
- Record different states and keep a lifetime history of your project
- Roll back to an earlier project state if something breaks
- Prototype new code and features without breaking the "production" version
- Avoid "regression-v1.R", "regression-v2.R", "regression-v3.R", ...
- Asynchronous workflows
  - Everyone has an independent copy of the project.
  - But, there is one "master" copy 

### Why GitHub?

- Backup your projects on remote servers
- Collaborate, discuss, plan all within a central location
- Share your work with a wider audience

???
- Single Author
  - Write code, documentation, reports, manuscripts.
  - Track changes on version control system
  - "Push" changes to cloud-based code-repository system
- Collaborative
  - You:
      - Work on a project locally 
      - Commit changes to the repo
      - Push changes to the remote repo
  - Others:
      - Pull changes from remote repo to local repo to ensure project is up to date
      - Work on project locally
      - Commit changes to the repo
      - Push changes to the repo
  - Branching:
      - Allow you to freely work on experimental and new features without fear of committing breaking changes to the master or production branch
      - Create branches for an independent line of development.
      - When finished with work on branch, issue a pull request for review. With pull requests, you are asking to merge your changes into the (usually) master branch.
      - Repo owners will need to review and test your code before merging into master.
      - If you decide that you don't want to merge in work you did in a new branch, that's ok too. Just delete the branch! 
  - Merge Conflicts:
      - Occur when there are conflicting changes to the same piece of code
      - To solve, locate the conflicting files. Change file to desired state. Continue merge to master branch

# Final Remarks

***

--

- A shift to a code-based workflow increases reproducibility
  - Point-and-click actions are not as reproducible as code in a script. Don't touch the mouse!
  - Analysis in Excel -&gt; Analysis in R, Python, Stata, SAS
  - Aim to do everything with code

- Abstract away manual actions for project management 
  - Embrace tools built to address these issues
  - **Git** to track file evolution and to manage the lifetime of a project
  - **GitHub** to share and distribute your work

- Adopt literate programming ideals
  - Spend time to explain your work in writing and other mediums (ie: diagrams, images, concept maps)
  - Enable others to understand the practical or theoretical significance of your work
